# Simple-Derivative-Calculator
- It creates a set of structs for representing and evaluating mathematical expressions and their derivatives. Each struct represents a particular mathematical expression (e.g., 𝑓(𝑥)=sin(𝑥)f(x)=sin⁡(x)) and supports symbolic (exact) differentiation (e.g. 𝑓′(𝑥)=cos(𝑥)f′(x)=cos⁡(x)).
- It supports Sin, Cos, Add , Mul and Monomial.
- Test code showes the usage.
